# Email Classification Models
## Overview
This project aims to train on a dataset of various spam emails and SNS messages to utilize a machine learning algorithms ultimately classify harmful contents feed back to the model. The project mainly use Python machine learning library `sklearn` to generate and train these classification models.

## Environement Setup
Once you download/clone the repository, we can start setting up the environment to run the project. Run the following command after you CD to the project directory to install any missing prerequisites libraries. 
```
python install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset Cleanup & Preparation
The dataset we have will needing further processing so running ` rename the script here ` to clean up the dataset while also features extract for our models training.
```
python rename the script
```
## Model Generation & Output
Now that we have both the environment and dataset, we can start running the ` rename the model script ` to generate the corresponding models which we can retrieve at a later point to do real-time classification.
```
python rename the script
```
